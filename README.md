# No Feeding Baby

## About
This is a fabric mod to prevent from feeding baby animals.

Someday, I was breeding many bees with flowers,
and I noticed that many of the flowers are eaten by baby bees instead of adult bees.
I cannot endure seeing that the precious flowers get eaten by baby bees,
although the flowers are not precious at all in my server.
So, I came up with the idea to write a mod to accomplish this goal.
It is also a chance for me to learn how to write a mod.

## Features
When you take food and right-click a baby animals, nothing will happen.
For example, wheats and baby cows, flowers and baby bees, etc.

This mod ensures that you will not waste any food on baby animals.

## Notes
This mod is designed for client uses.

## TODO
Now all the baby animals cannot be fed.
It is better if users can choose which baby animals can be fed.

I am learning YACL to write my config, but I am not sure if I have time to improve this mod.
