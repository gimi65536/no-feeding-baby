# No Feeding Baby

## About
This is a fabric mod to prevent from feeding baby animals.

Someday, I was breeding many bees with flowers,
and I noticed that many of the flowers are eaten by baby bees instead of adult bees.
I cannot endure seeing that the precious flowers get eaten by baby bees,
although the flowers are not precious at all in my server.
So, I came up with the idea to write a mod to accomplish this goal.
It is also a chance for me to learn how to write a mod.

## Features

### Basic
When you take food and right-click a baby animals, nothing will happen.
For example, wheats and baby cows, flowers and baby bees, etc.

This mod ensures that you will not waste any food on baby animals.

### Configurable
You can choose which baby animals can be fed by the configuration.

In the configuration, you can tell the mod to use whitelist mode or blacklist mode
and add the identifier (such as `minecraft:cow`) into the list to enable/disable
feeding.

## Notes
This mod is designed for client uses, but it should work in the server side.

## TODO
- It is better if users can *toggle* which baby animals can be fed in a more intuitive way,
	such as "ALT+right-click" a baby.
- Translation (not hard-coding texts)

I am not sure if I have time to do those, though.
