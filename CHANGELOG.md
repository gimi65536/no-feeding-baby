## Translation
This mod becomes translatable now.

Official supports for `en_us` and `zh_tw`.

## Easier way to config
Now players can put/drop an animal into/from the list
by ALT(default)+right click the baby animal with food.

You can also set a key to temporarily feed babies (if the server side allows),
or toggle the white/blacklist mode by a key.

## Commands for server side
*This mod is designed for client uses.*
However I still make this mod server-side usable.

To make it easier to server ops, I write commands.

*Note: Outputs of commands are not translatable, and I have no plan to improve this.*

### List Mode
`/nofeedingbaby mode [blacklist/whitelist/toggle]`

### Animal
`/nofeedingbaby animal [add/remove/toggle/status] id`
